<%= homework_hdr %>
* Learn Git and Github. I suggest reading Chapter 1 and 2 of [The Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book). 
* Begin working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. This assignment will get you to write some basic code with Ruby. You will learn how to read files work with data in arrays and hashes. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* Continue with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). Your success in the whole course will be strongly affected by how comfortable you get with Ruby. It's a really fun and interesting language.You should be at least up to Lesson 18 where you will learn about working with files. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %> 
* Read up on all the  <%= link_to_incubator :prod_candidates %> that are available. Try to undertand and visualize what each one might be about. Remember the caveat: Don't set the bar at "this is the most wonderful product idea I ever saw". Set it at "this is a product that could be interesting to develop and work on."
