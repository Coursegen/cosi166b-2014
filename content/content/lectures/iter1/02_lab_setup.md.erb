<%= homework_hdr %>
* Learn Git and Github. I suggest reading Chapter 1 and 2 of [The Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book). 
* Continue [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). Collect all the files you create in one directory. Please stick with it. Your success in the whole course will be strongly affected by how comfortable you get with Ruby. It's a really fund and interesting language.
* Begin work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. Bring in as much as you have so far.

#### Lab Objectives

* Continue with <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>.
