<%= homework_hdr %>
* Read "Agile Web Development with Rails" [AWDR] Chapter 1. It will walk you through installation. Here are some modifications that are important:
  * DO NOT install RVM. You don't need it and it will make your life difficult.
  * I hope by now you were convinced to work in a Linux partition or a Mac, and if not give me one more chance to talk you into it :)
  * Instead install rbenv, which is far simpler and does the same: [Rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv). Ask for help if you need it.
  * You need a simple text editor. If you don't have one, I recommend [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)
* Read [AWDR] Chapter 4. It will once again review Ruby with you. It should come very easy given the work you've done so far. Still there is good stuff to learn there, so don't cut corners!
