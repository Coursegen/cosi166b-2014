<%= homework_hdr %>
* Continue working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. Remember if you are having problems to get help from your peers or from one of the TAs. <%= deliverable "zip up the directory with the work so far and submit it." %>
* Continue [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). Collect all the files you create in one directory. By now you should be up to around Lesson 40. They are getting a lot more difficult, arent they? Don't give up or start slacking, keep at it!


#### Review: Git Basics
* Recommended local directory structure:
<%=code_begin%>
~/mydev
    /pa1
    /pa2-test
    /sdasdasd
    /experiment
    ...
<%=code_end %>
* Commands done only from your top level "mydev" directory
    * git clone (create a new directory from a repo on github)
* Commands done from inside an individual repos local directory
    * git add --all (add all changed files to staging)
    * git commit -m "message" (create a "commit" with all staged files)
    * git push (push all local commits up to github)
    * git pull (pull any changes made from github to look at it locally)
    * git status (see where things stand)
* NB: Don't do a git clone from 'inside' a local repo directory

#### Overview and course web site
