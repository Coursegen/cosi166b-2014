<%= homework_hdr %>
 Don't be scared by how much text is on this page. I am trying to be as detailed and specific as possible. I will answer all your questions about this and refine/revise this on the web site as we get closer to the Showcase. I will also be scheduling 1-1 meetings for each team later this week or early next week to help you get this as good as you can. I want everyone to achieve success! 

##### Logistics of Product Showcase
* Date: Wed May 6 at 1:30pm
* There will be 6 Product Reviewers
* Each team will have 15 minutes, 10 for presentation, 5 for questions

#### The work due for Today
* This is our equivalent of a final exam. Refer to the Grading info on the web site to see the impact.
* There are three deliverables: a demo, a presentation, and a portfolio page
* These are all team deliverables
* I expect that all of these will be in a 50-60% done state by Thursday
* See below for tips on each of these deliverables
* Everyone watch this video that gives fantastic tips on giving a good presentation: [This Week In Startups - Sharktank](http://thisweekinstartups.com/shark-tank-takeover-427/)
* Each team will do their demos+presentation and we will look at portfolio pages
 
#### What we are doing in class
* For any team who is ready, we can review your portfolio pages and your presentation slides one on one.
* The rest of the time will be used to continue to prepare and code on projects
Pito and Amin are available for consultation. Bring questions or areas where you want to consult
 
#### Details on final deliverables for the course
* Here are the details of what the deliverables should contain (by the showcase)
* There is a spot in Latte to submit it as well

##### General:
* This is not a marketing or selling course.
* In each of the deliverables, make sure there's a dose of technical info about:
  * The architecture
  * The key technologies used
  * The interesting technical parts of the product
  * Examples: background processing, two factor authentication, using of web services, real time processing, complicated or hairy databases, use of mapping or GPS, use of voice, using packages outside of the usuall ruby on rails universe, interesting computer science algorithms, etc,
 
##### Demo
* This is part of the presentation, after one or at most 2 slides
* Take around 5-7 minutes to demo your product. By now, you should be able to demonstrate your product!
* Yes there may be bugs and uglyness which you will have a week to fix
* You do need to work on a demo 'script'
* The best demo scripts tell a bit of a story where you try to 'hook' the listener with a scenario that they recognize
 
##### Presentation
* Should be Powerpoint, Google Presentation or whatever you prefer. (Prezo sometimes makes people dizzy)
* All members of the team will be part of the presentation. Not all students need to talk equal amounts.
* You should practice it at least once
* Demo is part of the presentation, but very close to the start
* Cover what the product does, what's interesting technically, what technologies used, for who does it solve what problem, and any preliminary idea on how it would make money.
 
##### Project Portfolio Page
* A single page web site, using Google Sites or something else you prefer.
* Objective is to showcase the results of your project
* You might cover
  * What the purpose of the product is, what kind of user would want it, and what it's functionality is.
  * Technologies used, beyond just RoR. What new and unusual tools, services, languages, and so on.
  * Interesting Engineering, how did you go beyond a vanilla web app and have to confront some engineering challenges
* Iclude at least one screenshot and also a diagram of the architecture
* Include names and emails of the team members
