<%= homework_hdr %>
* Read [Effective Use of white space in forms](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-white-space).
* Read [A Summary of User Interface Design Principles](http://www.sylvantech.com/~talin/projects/ui_design.html) and [Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/). Note: you may add your favorite other article about UI and UX design. <%= deliverable "A blog post about one of the principles from these or your readings and how it applies to your product. Prepare for a classroom discussion" %>
* Check out [Five Second Test](http://fivesecondtest.com) and choose an aspect of your product to test using this site. *Prepare to explain it in class!*
* Each product team: design the absolute minimum demo of your product that you want to have working by the product showcase. What is the essential coolness of your product? Can you demo that? Remember a perfect login or user settings page is not essential coolness. Think of the aha reaction you want in the viewer. Let's call that the SDV - Showcase Day Version (see <%= link_to_topic :product_plan_of_attack %>) - <%= team_deliverable "A detailed paper prototype of the SDV of your product. Detailed not because it has beautiful colors but because it covers the layout AND interactions that will work.. Use actual paper or balsamiq.com" %>

#### Project Teams midcourse progress review
This is not actually homework but a chance to catch up if you need it. This afternoon after class the TAs and I will review your progress on your product up to now. This will count as 10% of the 35% of your grade for the product. The other 25% will come through based on your work from now forward. Here's what we will be looking at:
  * progress on completing the steps of the roadmap
  * quality of the code so far
  * degree of challenge of their product plan
  * probability of success
  * preparation for PR meetings (as reported by PRs)
  * informal feedback from the PRs
  * TAs advisors assessment of teams progress

#### Conclusion

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience. 
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!
