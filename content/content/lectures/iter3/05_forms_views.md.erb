<%= homework_hdr %>
* Continue work on your search form example from a few days ago, by implementing all of Part 2 of <%= link_to_topic :hw_railsform %>.
* **This will take several hours of work!!!** I know you are doing similar stuff in the projects, however I also know that some people are not doing much programming. The purpose of this homework is to make sure everyone gets into it!
  * <%= deliverable "push the app to github, supply the github url and a very short screencast demoing the operation of the form, in a piazza post." %>

<%= include_topic :example_forms_views %>
