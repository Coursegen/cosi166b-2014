<%= homework_hdr %>
* Prepare with your team to do a standup presentation. 
* Skim [Patterns for Daily Standup Meetings](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html). Choose who on your team will speak.
* Keep talking and working on your projects
* Prepare to demo what you have so far

<%= callout("REMINDER", " Your portfolios will be reviewed and graded TODAY for progress.") %>

#### Product work
* Standups
  * One member from each team stands up, and takes 5 minutes to state the status of their project
  * Topics to cover:
    * What we accomplished so far
    * What we plan to accomplish next week
    * Anything blocking our progress?
* Split into teams and continue working on your products



<%= homework_hdr %>

* For each product, implement (or adapt) a User model: registration, login and logout. I recommend (strongly) that you follow the pattern that is laid out in [Ruby on Rails Tutorail](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/modeling-users#book_menu) - Chapters 6,7 and 8. <%= team_deliverable "Implement simple authentication for your product. Update your project's git repo with the new code." %>
* <%= team_deliverable "Prepare a demo of what you have working so far." %>

#### Project Work
* All teams use the full two hours (minus 20 minutes) to code on their projects.
* Pito and Amin are available for consultation

##### Demos
* Each team takes 5 minutes to summarize progress to date, what the plan is for the coming week, and demonstrate their product so far.
