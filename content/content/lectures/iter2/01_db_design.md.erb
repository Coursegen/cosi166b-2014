<%= homework_hdr %>
* Continue working on Programming Assignment 3, <%= link_to_topic :pa_mazes %>. As usual, you will be doing your coding in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* Do research on the "Active Record Pattern". 
  * A pattern is simply a way of arranging code, a common way of solving a design problem derived from research as well as real world practice. This particular pattern has to do with ways of tying databases into object oriented programs in a rich and convenient way.
  * Read [Active Record Pattern](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html) and also [ORM Hate](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html), both articles by a famous OO designer Martin Fowler.
  * <%= deliverable "Your observations about the ActiveRecord pattern. What you learned, how you would explain it to another programmer. What you understood and what you still don't follow." %>
* Develop an initial schema for your product.
  * Read [Basics of good database design in Web Development](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/03/17/the-basics-of-good-database-design-in-web-development/)
  * Product Teams: Using all that background, develop initial schema for your product. Include table names, field or attribute names, and relations or joins. <%= team_deliverable "Detailed initial schema for your product. Any form you want." %>
* Useful resources: <%= link_to_topic :rails_links %>
