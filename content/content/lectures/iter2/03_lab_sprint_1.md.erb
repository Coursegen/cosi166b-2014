<%= homework_hdr %>

* Finish working Programming Assignment 3, <%= link_to_topic :pa_mazes %>. As usual, you will be doing your coding in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* Read Chapter 6 of [AWDR]. 
  * It is important that you really try and execute all the code snippets there and get them to work. 
  * Notice that "rails new depot" creates a directory called "depot" whereever you are. So in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>, for example,
    * `cd cosi166b_cburkh`
    * `rails new depot`
    * `cd depot`
  * Follow along and do all the code in Chapter 6, prove to yourself that it runs.
  * You will discover that to write a web app you need to use many different 'langauges': Ruby, Html, css, and other languages. 
  * Don't expect to understand everything, we will be going over this several more times. But try, really try. Write down two things you just don't understand. <%= nb "Try hard to understand what is going on. You need this." %>
