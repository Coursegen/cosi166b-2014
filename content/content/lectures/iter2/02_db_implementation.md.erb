<%= homework_hdr %>
* NoSql dabases: There's a 'new' generation of databases which are non-relational often known as NOSQL databases. Here's one article about it: [NoSQL vs SQL](https://www.udemy.com/blog/nosql-vs-sql-2/). There are many many more. Do your own additional research and write your own view from that research about the advantages and disadvantages of NoSQL vs. 'traditional' SQL databases. <%= deliverable "Your report, 1 page or less." %>
* Read [AWDR]Chapter 5. Notice how he introduces what I called <%= link_to_topic :ux_flows %>. He calls it a Page Flow, but it's the same exact idea. You MUST have this because you won't be able to code the app without knowing what the flow is. It's fundamental! And also, notice how he discusses an initial guess at application data, which is the same as what you've been doing on your projects!.
* Continue working Programming Assignment 3, <%= link_to_topic :pa_mazes %>. As usual, you will be doing your coding in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.

<%= callout("REMINDER", " Your portfolios will be reviewed and graded TODAY for progress.") %>
