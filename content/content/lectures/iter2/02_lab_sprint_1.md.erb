<%= homework_hdr %>

* Finish working Programming Assignment 3, <%= link_to_topic :pa_mazes %>. As usual, you will be doing your coding in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
* If you didn't succeed working through [AWDR] Chapter 2's programming steps, do so now.
* Read [AWDR]Chapter 5. Notice how he introduces what I called <%= link_to_topic :ux_flows %>. He calls it a Page Flow, but it's the same exact idea. You MUST have this because you won't be able to code the app without knowing what the flow is. It's fundamental! And also, notice how he discusses an initial guess at application data, which is the same as what you've been doing on your projects!.

#### Comments about team work
* Several/most teams have an unoffical thought leader
* But don't wait for him/her to tell you what to do next
* Push and go around them if they are going too slowly!
* Remember that your project work is a major part of your grade

#### Look at next class
* Look at homework <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
