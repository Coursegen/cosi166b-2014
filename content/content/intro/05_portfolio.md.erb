title: Portfolio

#### What it is
Throughout this course there will be many programming homeworks. You will be organizing them into a coursework portfolio on the Brandeis server so that you are not constantly handing in bits and pieces.

<%= callout("IMPORTANT", " You are required to organize your portfolio in a very specific way so that we can automatically review your work.") %>

#### Grading
* Every weekyour TA will evaluate your portfolio directory and give it a score which will be based on:
  * How current you are with the assignments
  * How well you have applied the learnings so far regarding coding style, design, object orientation, good naming and so on.
  
#### Organizing your portfolio

You will be given a directory on the brandeis server called portfolio166b/yourname/cosi166b/.... This will be your work area for all programming assignments. Within that create the following directory structure:

* `portfolio166b/yourname/hardway` - Contains all the code written as you read along "Ruby The Hard Way", organized lesson by lesson, lesson1, lesson2, etc. In each lesson* subdirectory will have whatever ruby code you wrote for the lesson (e.g. ex5.rb) plus a readme.txt file with notes of what you learned from the lesson in one or two sentences.
* `portfolio166b/yourname/awdr` - Contains programs written as you read along in "Agile Web Development With Rails", organized by chapter, with separate subdirectories for chapters. Note that the big 'depot' project get its own separate dir.
* `portfolio166b/yourname/...` - Other discrete programming assignments such as <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>, <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %> and so on, each get a subdirectory under `portfolio166b/yourname`. In each subdirectory will have whatever ruby code you wrote for the lesson plus a readme.txt file with notes of what you learned from the lesson.

Note: you only need subdirectories for those lessons, chapters or progamming assignments that you actually got to.

#### Example

* A typical set up will look like this:
