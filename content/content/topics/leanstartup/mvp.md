title: Minimum Viable Product

#### The MVP or Minimum Viable Product
* "It's not necessarily minimal nor a product nor viable!"
* MVP is not a perfectly descriptive term
* "An experiment is a product" (From TLS book)
* Smallest increment of work that will test a hypothesis
* What forms can it take?
	* A static web site
	* A video
	* A simple free wordpress blog
	* Pricing scheme
	* Concierge MVP
	* Problem description
	* Solution description
	* Paper mockup
	* Actual Prototype
* The key is that it is *MINIUM!*
* MVP is always always related to a hypothesis (or more than one)
* Discussion: Does MVP mean that quality is not important?
