title: How web servers work

#### How a web server works
* Review of some basic concepts
  * Client and Server
  * Client asks for a page; server sends a page
  * Web server receives the request and creates the page and sends it back
* A level deeper:
  * Server (usually) looks inside a database for information
  * And runs an algorithm on that to create the output
  * And that's what gets sent back.

#### References
* <%= link_to_topic :url %>
* <%= link_to_topic :http %>
* <%= link_to_topic :html %>

#### Protocols and formats
* Client requests a certain url
* Request is transmitted with a protocol called http
* Server analyzes the url and generates a result
