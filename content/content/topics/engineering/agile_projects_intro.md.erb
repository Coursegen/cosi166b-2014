##### MVP
* Minimum Viable Product
* Get to that as soon as you possibly can!
* It has almost no features
* "Walking Skeleton"

##### Stories

* bite sized 'tasks' which are kept in priority order
* called stories because they typically describe a story about a user
* Work proceeds in cycles or iterations or sprints
* Can be between 1 and 4 weeks each
* Between sprints, story ordering can change to reflect latest view of priority
* Most important story to do NOW is on top

##### Trello

* Tools for tracking projects
* Free for small, public projects
* Good for Agile and Scrum and even Kanban, specifically
* There are lots of other free and not-free tools which could be used as an alternative. Ask me if you want.
