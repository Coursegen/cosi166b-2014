title: Continuous Integration and Deployment
---

#### Continuous Integration and Deployment
* Objective 1: Make sure that bugs are detected as early as possible
  * Make sure that your source code is consistent, and integrates
  * How? Have as much testing as you can
  * Push all code to your source code repository
  * Automatically triggers a pull/run all tests
  * Ideally: report to team and to individual developer
* Objective 2: Make sure users can start playing with new product asap
  * Once integration works, push it out to a server
  * Often there's a test or staging server
  * Historically: Release every year, 6 months, month, week. Now: Serious standard is release multiple times a day!
  * Automatic and continuous deployment
* Let's take a look at my Codeship.io and Heroku.com installations and review how they work
