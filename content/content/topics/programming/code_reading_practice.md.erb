title: Code Reading Practice
---
Some of you have said that you're interested in investing more time in becoming master programmers. One of the best ways of doing that is reading other people's code. I've selected 4 libraries that are all pretty small and digestable for your consideration.

Because I am currently teaching Ruby, these examples are all Ruby. But a similar list would be easy to build for other languages. While each language has some unique capabilities that will be exploited in examples, most of what you learn in these examples would apply equally to other languages

#### The list

* [SignalLamp](https://github.com/JEG2/signal_lamp)
* [TimeTress](https://github.com/kytrinyx/timetress)
* [Inflecto](https://github.com/mbj/inflecto)
* [MicroMachine](https://github.com/soveran/micromachine/blob/master/lib/micromachine.rb)

#### Proposed Process
1. Find a group of two or three other, equally passionate programmers and decide on one of these programs to study. 
1. On your own study the library. Write a sample program using it so you really know what it is supposed to do. Read it on your own to orient yourself.
1. Get together around a single computer and go through the program, line by line and discuss and explain what it does, all the while tapping into the web and ruby documentation to follow up on questions that are raised.
