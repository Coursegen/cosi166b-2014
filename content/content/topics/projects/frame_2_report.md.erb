---
#### Report
* 4-10 pages, including diagrams, photos, graphs or whatever
* Incorporates all the content of the <%= link_to_topic :frame_1_report %>, revised as much as you require
* Format is PDF

#### How to write an excellent report
* **Flow.** This report will be read as a unit, without reference to previous drafts. It should have a logical flow of an argument with an introduction and a conclusion.
* **Try to think bigger.** You will need to make a case that the product will be a viable business.
* **Be Serious.**Your work is evaluated not just on whether you follow the steps or the format but based on whether you are being realistic and intellectually honest about your proposal. Would you actually pitch this to an Angel?
* **Get Out.** Everyone needs to get out of the building more. Go beyond your friends. Talk to strangers!
* **Professionalism.*** Give consideration to visual appearance of the report, it should look professional
* **Substance** Try to have as much substance as you can based on outside research, meetings, references etc. Show that you've 'done your homework'


#### Suggested Contents

* Content of Frame 1 report is incorporated, revised and edited as much as required
* A visual mockup or good paper prototype to use in further experiments and as input to the design. It should include all the important screens and give the reader a sense of the product. 
* A diagram showing the flow of screen to screen in the user interface and explanation thereof.
* An architectural diagram of the product, site, app or service. An idea of how it could be built.
	1. Major technological risks are called out
	1. Preliminary technical architecture:
		1. Database schema (Domain Model) makes sense and is explained well
	  1. Tables, fields, joins and so on are worked out
	  1. Some thinking about communications and where the data is stored
	  1. Overall system architecture - what are the major components
	  1. Some sense of how the overall product will be built
* List of stories. Don't just show a big list. You need to organize them into sets of related functionality, sometimes called "epics", for the purposes of presentation. For example: 
	* "Core Proximity Functionality (4 Stories)" or 
	* "Abilities to define ad-hoc survey for real time feedback (5 stories)" or 
	* "Visualize and change users visibility to other users (5 stories)" or 
	* "Animal shelter registration and profile updating (3 stories)".
* Strategy going forward: Immediate next steps; identified risks and ways of addressing them; reasons to believe this will be a fundable product going although further pivots will be needed
