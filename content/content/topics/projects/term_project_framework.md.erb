title: Term Project Framework
---
The purpose of the Term Project is to give you an open ended, but structured hands-on opportunity to:

* Apply the principles and concepts of lean startup and product discovery
* Think clearly about setting real goals for a product or business, whether they are to make lots of money or otherwise put a dent in the universe.
* Develop and practice the discipline to invest time and effort in only what is most important at any point

During the "Lean Immersion" period of the course everyone will be applying Lean Startup to a product idea that I have provided. The purpose is to do a practice round without the pressure of inventing a product.

The, during the second part of the course you will pursue a Term Project that you conceive of following a defined framework, which will divide the work roughly into three frames of 3 weeks each. You should expect to pivot once or twice during that phase.

Challenge yourselves: We are looking for something with a potential big impact. A "big idea" that can perhaps change the world in some way. Not just a feature, but a product. 

Remember 9 out of 10 startups fail. If you're doing it right, you fail fast instead of spending months and years on something that's not gonna pan out. Our goal here is to improve those odds.

There will be 3 Frames of work on the projects. At the end of eacg Frame, students will prepare and present the results of the work.
