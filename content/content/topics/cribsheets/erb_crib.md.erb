#### Intro to ERB
* "Embedded Ruby"
* One of a class of 'template languages'
* There are many
* They do a simple job (used to be called "mail merge")

##### What it does
* Erb file without any `<% %>` blocks remains unchanged
* `<% %>` **must** contain legal ruby code
* Let's look at [ErbDemo](https://github.com/pitosalas/erbdemo)
* The code between the angle brackets is evaluated.
* *And only in the case of `<%= %>` it's inserted into the resulting text
