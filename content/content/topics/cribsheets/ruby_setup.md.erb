title: Ruby Highly Specific Set Up Instructions
desc: How to set up your personal computer for Ruby and Rails etc.

Ruby is a big magical world with tons of tools, libraries, successfull instructions, and dead-end tutorials. That's why I will give you highly specific instructions. Please follow them to the letter. Why? Because I've been down the road and I can avoid you pain and help you live longer.

#### MS Windows

If you have a windows computer, I strongly urge you to find out how to create a second Linux boot partition. 

Many students have traveled this road before you and while (using Turing-complete kind of logic) you can technically do everything with Windows, the road is absolutely full of potholes and pain.

Setting up a Linux partition is easy and very cheap. You need about 14Gig free. You will find the user interface fairly familiar. Overall things will go easier.

#### Mac and Linux

These are the preferred platforms. They both come with Ruby preinstalled and you can lead a happy life without changing anything. 

#### Other required tools on Mac

* <%= ir("Do not install RVM or RbEnv.") %>These two tools are to allow a proficient programmer to change what version of Ruby they are using. You will not need them and they will make your life more difficult.
* <%= ir("Do install Homebrew") %> It's the easiest tool to allow you to install other utilities with the least amount of fuss
* <%= ir("Do install Sublime Text 2.") %> You will need a simple text editor to do this work. If you already have a favorite, fine. But if you don't Sublime Text 2 is what many people use, and it's nice and easy

#### Other required tools on Linux
* TBD

#### If you didn't follow my advice and still end up on Windows
* <%= ir("Reconsider!") %> You should go back and install Linux.
* <%= ir("Do not use NOTEPAD.") %> On Windows, Notepad is very weak and will cause you headaches. Of course if you followed my advice above you are not using Windows.
