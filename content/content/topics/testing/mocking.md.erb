#### Mocking
* Overview
	* SUT ("System under test")
	* Collaborators (other objects needed to test SUT)
	* Decoupling is a major goal
* What is a Mock?
	* An object that stands in for another object during testing
	* Make sure that only the right methods are called
	* Other terms: doubles, stubs, and others. Don't get confused.
* Advantages
	* Decoupling is always a good thing.
		* Performance
		* Maintainability
		* Testability
	* If you introduce a bug in a class
		* Only the tests that are testing that class will fail
		* So, fewer false positives
	* Disadvantages
		* Need to maintain to consistency between the mock and the class-being-mocked
		* Otherwise you may be testing somethingn that doesn't even exist
* Coding example: [Doubles Demo](https://github.com/pitosalas/doublesdemo)
* Real world example:
    * Let's look at some of the code that runs this web site.
    * Note slightly different syntax because of RSpec vs. minitest/spec
    * [citem_spec.rb](https://github.com/pitosalas/curriculu/blob/master/spec/citem_spec.rb)
    * [toc_spec.rb](https://github.com/pitosalas/curriculu/blob/master/spec/toc_spec.rb)
