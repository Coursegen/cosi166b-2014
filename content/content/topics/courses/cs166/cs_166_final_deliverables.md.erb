title: Cosi 166 Final Deliverables
---
#### General
* This is not a marketing or selling course.
* In each of the deliverables, make sure there's a dose of technical info about:
  * The architecture
  * The key technologies used
  * The interesting technical parts of the product
  * Examples: background processing, two factor authentication, using of web services, real time processing, complicated or hairy databases, use of mapping or GPS, use of voice, using packages outside of the usuall ruby on rails universe, interesting computer science algorithms, etc...

#### Logistics of Product Showcase
* Date: Wed May 6 at 1:30pm
* There will be 6 Product Reviewers
* Each team will have 15 minutes, 10 for presentation, 5 for questions

#### Demo
* This is part of the presentation, near the beginning. So do the demo around the 2nd or 3d slide. Then after the demo do the rest of the presentation.
* Take around 5-7 minutes to demo your product. By now, you should be able to demonstrate your product!
* Yes there may be bugs and uglyness which you will have a week to fix
* You do need to work on a demo 'script'
* The best demo scripts tell a bit of a story where you try to 'hook' the listener with a scenario that they recognize
 
#### Presentation
* Logistics
	* Should be Powerpoint, Google Presentation or whatever you prefer. (Prezo sometimes makes people dizzy)
	* All members of the team will be part of the presentation. Not all students need to talk equal amounts.
	* You should practice it at least once
	* Demo is part of the presentation, but very close to the start
* Ideas on what to cover - no need to cover each and every one
	* What does the product do
	* What's interesting technically
	* What interesting Cosi concepts or algorithms?
	* What specific problem does it solve, for who?
	* Where can it be improved or expanded?
	* How would a customer deploy or adopt it?
	* Preliminary ideas on how it might make money
	* Conclusion

#### Project Portfolio Page
* A single page web site, using Google Sites or something else you prefer.
* Objective is to showcase the results of your project
* You might cover
  * What the purpose of the product is, what kind of user would want it, and what it's functionality is.
  * Technologies used, beyond just RoR. What new and unusual tools, services, languages, and so on.
  * Interesting Engineering, how did you go beyond a vanilla web app and have to confront some engineering challenges
* Iclude at least one screenshot and also a diagram of the architecture
* Include names and emails of the team members
