#### Scores
There are many expecations, homeworks, assigments and/or quizes, and a several large ones. All of them are individually scored on a scale of 1-10 which you can interpret as follows:

* 9 - 10: Exceeds Expectations (A- -> A+)
* 8 - 9: Meets Expectations (B- -> B+)
* 7 - 8: Needs Improvement (C- -> C+)
* 6 - 7: Unacceptable (D- -> D+)

#### Mid term and Final Grade
These are calculated as a weighted average of the individual homeworks. The weights are as follows:

* **Class Participation:** 20%
  * Do you show up on time (or let the teachers know ahead of time if you cannot?)
  * Do you ask good questions, and contribute to the discussion?
  * Do you help the class move forward and stay focused?
  * When called on or in discussions do you demonstrate that you have done the assigned reading or work?

* **Team Contribution:** 20%
  * Do you contribute personally to your team?
  * Are you a positive influence on productivity?
  * Do your team mates like working with you?
  * Are you at the center of problems or of solutions?
  * This is based on a self- and peer- assessment

* **Final Project:** 40%
  * Does the product work and do what it supposed to do?
  * Is the architecture reasonable and sound?
  * What aspects of the product did you contribute to?
  * Does it represent good software engineering practices?
  * Can you explain how it works?
  * Did you go well beyond the basic Rails structures that you learned in class and discover and apply new techniques, tools, technologies?
  * This is based on a self- and peer- assessment

* **Programming Assignments**: 20%
  * Does the program work?
  * Does it use language features in a good way?
  * Is it designed with good performance in mind?
  * Does it follow good coding practices?

* **Extra Credit:** 
  * Ask me if you want to do an extra credit assignment
  * Any time until 2 weeks before the end of the course
  * Note: it's easier to push your grade up by doingn well on the core assignments
  * An excellent job here will bump your grade at most one step (e.g. B+ -> A-)
